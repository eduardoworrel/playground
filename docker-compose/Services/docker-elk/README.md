## Philosophy

We aim at providing the simplest possible entry into the Elastic stack for anybody who feels like experimenting with
this powerful combo of technologies. This project's default configuration is purposely minimal and unopinionated. It
does not rely on any external dependency or custom automation to get things up and running.

Instead, we believe in good documentation so that you can use this repository as a template, tweak it, and make it _your
own_. [sherifabdlnaby/elastdocker](https://github.com/sherifabdlnaby/elastdocker) is one example among others of project that builds upon this idea.
